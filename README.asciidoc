This is a collection of my test simulations.
They are simplified models for "educational purposes".
Their realism varies, from vary crude models to a bit more realistic.
The parameters are currently for Finland.

== The lattice model

See link:lattice[the lattice directory] for more details.

=== Building the lattice model

Requirements (Ubuntu):

* `libmagick++-dev`
+
Used for animation output.

The Makefile:

* Requires path to `Magick++-config`

Magick++ is a real hassle with its build files.
If you're using an IDE to develop the application, you need to have the Magick++ headers in the IDE's project path.
